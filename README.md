# zenji

A customizable, responsive (mobile-first), [ZenphotoCMS](http://zenphoto.org) theme.

This theme was originally written by @gjr-osweb in 2014/2015 already and never released. We had almost forgotten that he had sent it for review. The ZenphotoCMS team has roughly cleaned up some code issues so it should be generally compatible with the current release.
